<p>So, basically the year over! I decided to write this little post because 2017 was a agitate and ‘weird’ year for me.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h3 id="month-of-resultados-digitias">10 month of Resultados Digitias</h3>
<p>This year I spend 10 months as a Software Engineer at Resultados Digitais (RD). And although I really don’t like the city I moved (Florianopolis) the RD was one of the best things that happen in my professional life this year.</p>
<p>This 10 months can easily read as ‘2 years’ or something like this. I learned a lot with great people and made friends for a life. I would thank guys from Resultados Digitais for everything! especially to the friends and colleagues of Dispatch Team. You guys are great!</p>
<p>As I am looking into opportunities to working remotely and for some European company, I decided to move forward and leave RD, what drives us to the next big thing of 2017: GuestReady!</p>
<h3 id="starting-work-for-guestready">Starting work for GuestReady</h3>
<p>After the 10 months at Resultados Digitais I had the opportunity to join to GuestReady! I left Florianopolis city and currently I live in a small town that makes me happier and full of joy (not always, :d).</p>
<p>GuestReady had a team distributed across 3 continents (Europe, South America, and Asia). The engineering team is fully distributed between Brazil, Ukraine, Czech Republic and UK.</p>
<p>And I could not have made a better choice! Working for GuestReady is so exciting! Be part of a team full remotely is a challenge, but also open opportunity for many good things.</p>
<p>In 2018 (February, I think) I will move to Europe (Budapest and Prague) for 3 months with a Brazilian friend (and soon GuestReady colleague) in order to meet some colleagues and enjoy the ride, and of course, continue help making GuestReady better.</p>
<h3 id="see-you-guys-in-the-next-year">See you guys in the next year!</h3>
<p>So, in short, that’s it a would like to share. I hope everybody has a great end of the year.</p>
<p>See you!!</p>
